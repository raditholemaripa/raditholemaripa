# 👋 Hi, I’m Radithole Maripa  
### 🚀 Vision-Based Robotics & Autonomous Systems Developer

Welcome to my GitHub! I specialize in crafting robotics tools and systems using **C++**, **OpenCV**, and **ROS2**,
with a strong foundation in mathematics and algorithm design.

---

### 🧠 What I Do
- Develop **modular C++ libraries** for computer vision and robotics
- Build tools for **object tracking**, **autonomous navigation**, and **motion planning**
- Work with **ROS2** and **robot simulators** (Webots, Gazebo)
- Deliver freelance solutions to robotics teams and research groups
